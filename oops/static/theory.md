## static keyword

We can use static keyword with ...

1. variable (class level) -> cannot use with local variable
2. methods
3. block
4. inner class (nested class) -> cannot use with outer class

- We can access static variable directly using the Class name. We do not have to initialize the object of the class.

- static variable belongs to the class, not object.

- If we try to access non-static variable directly using class - error ...

```java
Demo.java:8: error: non-static variable a cannot be referenced from a sta
tic context
    System.out.println(Test.a);
                           ^
1 error
```

- static variables are used for memory management.
- static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.

### static method

- static method belongs to class not object.
- static method can be called directly by class names follows : ClassName.methodName().

### rules of static methods

1. **static** methods belong to the class, not to the object.
2. A **static** method can be accessed directly by class name and doesn't need any object.
3. A **static method** can access only **static data**. It cannot access **non-static data**.

```java
StaticDemo.java:4: error: non-static variable i cannot be referenced from
 a static context
    System.out.println(i);
                       ^
1 error
```

4. A **static method** can call only **other static-methods** and cannot call a **non-static method**.

```java
StaticDemo.java:4: error: non-static method show() cannot be referenced f
rom a static context
    show();
    ^
1 error
```

5. A **static method** cannot refer to **this** or **super** keyword anyway.

```java
StaticDemo.java:15: error: non-static variable this cannot be referenced
from a static context
    System.out.println(this.i);
                       ^
1 error
```
