## OOPs (Object Oriented Programming System / Structure)

- OOPs is a programming paradigm / methodology
- Paradigm is a way of doing a task
- various types of paradigm ->
  - **object oriented paradigm**

### Class - Object real world example

Animal - Class
Dog, Cat - Objects
run(), eat() - methods of the class

### Class :

1. Collection of Objects
2. Class is not a real world entity. It is just a template or blueprint.
3. Class does not occupy memory.
4. class contains -
   - methods
   - constructor
   - fields
   - blocks
   - nested class

### Methods :

1. A set of code which perform a particular task
2. advantages of methods -
   - Code reusability
   - code optimization

### Object :

1. Object is an instance of Class - Dog is an instance of Animal.
2. Object is a real world entity.
3. Object occupies memory.
4. Object consists of -
   - Identity - name of the dog
