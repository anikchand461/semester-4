## Constructor

1. is a block (similar to method) having same name as that of class name
2. Constructor does not have any return type, not even void.
3. The only modifiers applicable for constructors are public, protected, default and private.
4. It executes automatically when we create an object.

### use -

- to initialize an object.

### Types of constructor :

1. Default constructor ()
2. No-arg constructor (user defined constructor)
3. Parameterized constructor (constructor qith )

### Why constructor does not have a return type ?

1. the work of constructor is to initialize the object. Now if only object is initialized, nothing to return. So constructor has no return type.
2. If we do not create constructor, then the compiler by default create the constructor and then the compiler cannot judge the return value of the constructor.
